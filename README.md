# binary_search_trees
This project's goal is to create an implementation of the [Binary Search Tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) data structure using Ruby.

Methods implemented:
* `#build_tree`
* `#pretty_print` aka `#pp`
* `#insert`
* `#delete`
* `#find`
* `#level_order` or `#level_order_recursive`
* `#inorder`
* `#preorder`
* `#postorder`
* `#height`
* `#depth`
* `#balanced?`
* `#rebalance`

This project was made as an exercise for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-binary-search-trees).
